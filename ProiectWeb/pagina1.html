                    <p>
                    Several years ago when I lived in Hawaii, a neighbor's orange tomcat decided to “adopt” me and basically lived in the lanai room attached to the house. The room had an open end to the front yard, covered with a screen, and also a partial kitchen where you could cook, entertain, etc.
                    <br><br>
                    One day I had just finished cooking a whole broiler chicken, took it out of the oven and put it on a platter. Then I got a phone call in the other room, walked over and talked for maybe five minutes.
                    <br><br>
                    I came back to find an empty platter; no chicken nor trace of a chicken anywhere. I milled around the lanai room and then went out through the screen at the end of the room to the front yard, where I witnessed our dear orange tomcat dragging the chicken across the front lawn.
                    <br><br>
                    I took it away from him and took it back to the lanai room. He followed me, jumped up on the counter and insisted on dragging that chicken away once more, knocking it on the floor and showing quite an indignant attitude of, <span class="important">“It’s mine and you can’t have it.”</span></p>

                    I work in television and recently adopted a rescue with my husband. Baxter (the dog) had just finished crate and potty training and was doing so well I decided to take him to work with me one day. (The office is pet-friendly.)
                    <br><br>
                    Not five minutes after we arrived, he relieved himself all over the very expensive shoes of one of our cast. They were gracious and laughed about it, and he's never done anything like it since.
                    <br><br>
                    I guess he was just excited to meet his first celebrity.

                    <p>I smelled something funny when I was getting ready for work one day. I followed the smell to the kitchen, where I found that my cat had turned on my gas stove and was standing over the burner huffing the fumes. Needless to say, I was forced to remove the knobs from my stove, and only put them on when I need to use it.</p>

                 <h3>Rex</h3>
                 <div>
                    <p>I have a pet turtle named Rex. He likes me so much he follows me around the house slowly. He finds me and lies on his back, waiting to be tickled. I tickle him and pick him up and get him a bit of food. Rex likes cheese and I always feed it to him. Rex also likes to play with small marbles I roll them 30cm away and he follows it and tries to move it with his hands. Rex has a shell and if anyone did step on him, which hasn't happened, he would not die. Rex was a little newborn at the pet shop so I asked if I could buy him.
                    <br><br>
                    One day I had to go to school. I had bought Rex on the weekend and I am now going to school. I packed my bag and shut the door. I scanned the door and the hall and there was no turtle. I sighed and turned around and two big green eyes stared back at me. Rex. I put him inside and walked off to the bus stop. 10 minutes later a green shell walked up to me when the bus pulled in. I sighed and put Rex in my hat and walked onto the bus. 
                    <br><br>
                    Later when I got home from school, I told Mum what had happened when Rex followed me to school. He sat at my desk and watched me do my work and I was the only one doing work because everyone was looking at Rex and thinking, “What a cute turtle” and “What is a turtle doing at school?”. I fed Rex and put him in his mini bed. The next morning I felt my head was as heavy as a brick,then two big green eyes were straight in front of my face. He was standing on my face! I didn't move for what seemed like hours and then a long wet tongue licked my nose. The turtle fell off me and landed on his back. I then gave him a big tummy tickle.</p>
